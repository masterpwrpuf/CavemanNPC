### Caveman Rokk
Rokk currently sells Leather, Tiger, Leopard, and Zebra skins, as well as the Wooden Club, Stone Javelin, Pet Rock, and Music Box.

# Planned Features
* Make a better Wooden Club sprite
* Make a Stone Javelin sprite
* Make a music box sprite (When placed)
* Fix Pet Rock's sprite (Edges are too bright)
* Add detail to the Caveman sprite
* Make the Pet Rock spawn, but not move after spawn (Not sure how to do that yet)
* Change the buy price of Stone Javelins (Its too high, when you can craft 5 at a time for cheaper)
