![alt text](https://github.com/masterpwrpuf/CavemanNPC/blob/master/Icons/iconrokk.png "Caveman Rokk Icon")

Rokk currently sells [Leather](https://terraria.gamepedia.com/Leather), Tiger, Leopard, and Zebra [skins](https://terraria.gamepedia.com/Animal_Skins), as well as the Wooden Club, Stone Javelin, Pet Rock, and Music Box.

Rokk doesn't know how he got to this land, but he will gladly defend the home from any intruders until he can find a way to get home.

### Wooden Club
![alt text](https://github.com/masterpwrpuf/CavemanNPC/blob/master/Icons/iconclub.png "Wooden Club Icon")

A simple Wooden Club, Rokk's weapon of choice. Deals a base 50 damage with a decently fast use time.
(Yes, I know the sprite for this looks like trash, I'm not an artist.)

### Stone Javelin (Buggy)
![alt text](https://github.com/masterpwrpuf/CavemanNPC/blob/master/Icons/iconjavelin.png "Stone Javelin Icon")

A simple Stone Javelin, thrown by some of Rokk's people. He thinks this type of weapon is barbaric, opting to use his trusty club.
(The sprite for this is the default sprite from ExampleMod)

### Pet Rock
![alt text](https://github.com/masterpwrpuf/CavemanNPC/blob/master/Icons/iconrock.png "Pet Rock Icon")

Rocky, as Rokk likes to call him, is, well... a rock. There is nothing special about this rock really. Rocky is on loan from Rokk's friend, Patrick.

# Planned Features
* Make a better Wooden Club sprite
* Make a Stone Javelin sprite
* Make a music box sprite (When placed)
* Fix Pet Rock's sprite (Edges are too bright)
* Add detail to the Caveman sprite
* Make the Pet Rock spawn, but not move after spawn (Not sure how to do that yet)
* Change the buy price of Stone Javelins (Its too high, when you can craft 5 at a time for cheaper)

# Possible Features
* A custom boss with music relevant to the current Music Box
* Add more lore as to how Rokk came to this place and time

# Known Bugs
* ~~Rokk's attack doesn't actually do damage 100% of the time. Not sure why, or how to fix it currently.~~
* Stone Javelins throw 2 at a time, and you can't throw another until the currently thrown javelins hit the ground.
