# Current Features
* Caveman NPC, Rokk
* Wooden Club Weapon (20 Silver)
* Stone Javelin Weapon (30 Silver)
* Pet Rock (20 Gold)
* Music Box (50 Gold)

### Caveman Rokk
Rokk currently sells Leather, Tiger, Leopard, and Zebra skins, as well as the Wooden Club, Stone Javelin, Pet Rock, and Music Box.

Rokk doesn't know how he got to this land, but he will gladly defend the home from any intruders until he can find a way to get home.

### Wooden Club
A simple Wooden Club, Rokk's weapon of choice. Deals a base 50 damage with a decently fast use time.

### Stone Javelin (Buggy)
A simple Stone Javelin, thrown by some of Rokk's people. He thinks this type of weapon is barbaric, opting to use his trusty club.

# Planned Features
* Make a better Wooden Club sprite
* Make a Stone Javelin sprite
* Make a music box sprite (When placed)
* Fix Pet Rock's sprite (Edges are too bright)
* Add detail to the Caveman sprite
* Make the Pet Rock spawn, but not move after spawn (Not sure how to do that yet)
* Change the buy price of Stone Javelins (Its too high, when you can craft 5 at a time for cheaper)

# Possible Features
* A custom boss with music relevant to the current Music Box
* Add more lore as to how Rokk came to this place and time

# Known Bugs
* Rokk's attack doesn't actually do damage 100% of the time. Not sure why, or how to fix it currently.
* Stone Javelins throw 2 at a time, and you can't throw another until the currently thrown javelins hit the ground.
